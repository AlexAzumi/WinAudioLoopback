Simple windows app that allows to channel a input sound to a output device.

## Why does this exists?

Simply because I needed a simple solution for listening my Nintendo Switch audio (or line in) through my computer audio.
I found out that in Windows is quite complicated to do this without
going deep in the sound settings.

## What does this application can do?

Just one thing, channel any input audio to any output device, one at a time
and with volume control. That's all!

## Will it get updates?

Problably I did not even update the default icon.
